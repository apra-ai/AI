# K-Nearest Neighbors Regression

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for regression, using **Euclidean distance** as the distance metric. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet effective model, especially suited for smaller datasets, and is based on the idea that similar data points are located close to each other in the feature space.

## Core Concept

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a **non-parametric** method that makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data. In regression, the model predicts the value of a data point based on the values of its K nearest neighbors. The distance between the points is computed using **Euclidean distance**.

### Euclidean Distance
The **Euclidean distance** between two points \( P = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) \) and \( Q = (q_1, q_2, ..., q_n) \) in an n-dimensional space is calculated using the following formula:

\[
d(P, Q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_i - q_i)^2}
\]

In this project, this formula is used to measure the similarity between a test point and all training points.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: The data is split into training and test sets.
2. **Normalization**: Before applying the KNN algorithm, the features are normalized to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The **Euclidean distance** is used to find the K nearest neighbors for each test sample.
4. **Prediction**: The predicted value is computed as the mean of the target values of the K nearest neighbors.
5. **Evaluation**: The performance of the model is assessed using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression Dataset**, which is available on Kaggle at the following link:

[K-Nearest Neighbors Regression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bkanupam/knearestneighboursregression-dataset)

It contains housing data with features such as square footage, year built, and the number of bedrooms. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on these features.
