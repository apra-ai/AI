# AI Projects Repository

Welcome to my AI Projects Repository! This repository contains a variety of AI/ML projects that I have developed to showcase my skills and knowledge.
Each project is organized into different folders based on the techniques, models, and datasets used.

## Projects Overview

### Cross-Validation
The **Cross-Validation** project demonstrates the implementation of K-Fold Cross-Validation techniques for model evaluation.
It is a standalone project that allows testing of machine learning models using cross-validation and provides a detailed analysis of the model performance.

### Mathematical Models
In the **mathematical-models** folder, you will find machine learning models that I have implemented from scratch, such as:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

These models were developed without relying on any external libraries (except for NumPy for basic mathematical operations) to gain a deep understanding of how machine learning algorithms work internally.

### Deep Learning
The **deep-learning** folder includes projects that use deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. A notable project here is:
- **MNIST Classification**: A deep learning model built using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).
