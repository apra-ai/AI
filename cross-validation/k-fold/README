### Data Description

The dataset used for training and testing in this project is from the [SMS Spam Collection v.1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate).
It contains over 5,000 messages that have been collected and curated for research on SMS spam filtering.

### Key Features

- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Automatically splits the dataset into training and testing subsets, helping to mitigate overfitting and provide a more reliable estimate of model performance.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Uses `GaussianNB` from `sklearn` for classification tasks.
- **Majority Voting**: Combines predictions from multiple models (trained on each fold) using a majority vote.
